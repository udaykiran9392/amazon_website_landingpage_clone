## 🖼️ Thumbnail Design (for GitHub Preview or YouTube Cover)

Here’s a design idea you can **generate or create in Canva/Figma**:

---

### 🔶 Thumbnail Concept Description:

- **Size**: 1280x720px (for GitHub/social preview)
- **Background**: A light gray/white preview of your landing page (screenshot)
- **Overlay**:
  - **Top left**: Amazon logo (semi-transparent)
  - **Center**:
    - Bold text: `Amazon Clone Landing Page`
    - Subtext: `Built with HTML & CSS`
  - **Bottom right**: Your name or GitHub handle

If you'd like, I can **generate the thumbnail image** for you — just upload a screenshot of your landing page or tell me the theme/colors you'd prefer!
